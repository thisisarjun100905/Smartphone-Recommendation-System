# Smartphone Recommendation System 📱

## Overview 🌟
The Smartphone Recommendation System is a machine learning project aimed at recommending the most suitable smartphones based on user preferences. The system uses clustering techniques, similarity measures, and other machine learning algorithms to group similar smartphones and provide tailored recommendations.

## Features 🔍
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses a dataset of phone specifications.
- **Clustering**: Implements K-Means clustering to group similar smartphones.
- **Similarity Measures**: Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), cosine similarity, and Pearson correlation to improve recommendation accuracy.
- **Feature Analysis**: Provides insights into feature distribution across clusters.


## Workflow 🛠️

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**:
   - Gather a dataset of smartphone specifications.
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset (handle missing values, normalize features, etc.).

2. **Clustering and Analysis**:
   - Apply K-Means clustering to group similar smartphones.
   - Analyze clusters to identify patterns and trends.

3. **Recommendation Engine**:
   - Use KNN, cosine similarity, and Pearson correlation to recommend smartphones based on user preferences.

4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model using metrics like silhouette score and user feedback.

## Installation 💻

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phone-recommendation-system.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd phone-recommendation-system
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage 🏃‍♂️

1. Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Get recommendations by running the recommendation script:
   ```bash
   python recommend.py --user_input "User's input here"
   ```

## Future Work 🚀
- Incorporate user reviews and ratings into the recommendation engine.
- Implement a web-based interface for easier interaction.
- Expand the dataset to include more recent smartphone models.
